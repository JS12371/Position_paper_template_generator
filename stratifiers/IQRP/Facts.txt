The Medicare program pays acute care hospitals for inpatient services under the Inpatient
Prospective Payment System (“IPPS”).  Under IPPS, the Medicare program pays
hospitals predetermined, standardized amounts per discharge, subject to certain payment
adjustments.  The standardized amounts are increased each year by the “market basket
update” to account for increases in operating costs.    
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (“MMA”) of 2003,
Section 501(b), amended 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(b)(3)(B) to establish the Inpatient Hospital Quality Reporting program ("Hospital IQRP"). The Hospital IQRP requires each hospital to submit quality measure data “…in a form and manner, and at a time, specified by the Secretary.”  The Hospital IQRP was expanded by Section 5001(a)
of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.  For fiscal years 2015 and beyond, federal law
specifies that a hospital that fails to report the required quality data under the Hospital IQRP
be penalized by reducing the hospital’s IPPS market basket percentage increase for the
relevant year by one-fourth. 42 C.F.R. § 412.64(d)(2)(i)(C).  Specifically, the regulation at
42 C.F.R. § 412.64(d)(2)(i)(C) states: 

    2)(i) In the case of a “subsection (d) hospital,” as defined under section
    1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, that does not submit quality data on a quarterly basis to
    CMS, in the form and manner specified by CMS, the percentage increase in the
    market basket index (as defined in § 413.40(a)(3) of this chapter) for prospective
    payment hospitals is reduced -  
        (A) For fiscal years 2005 and 2006, by 0.4 percentage points; and  
        (B) For fiscal year 2007 through 2014, by 2 percentage points.  
        (C) For fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal years, by one-fourth.
